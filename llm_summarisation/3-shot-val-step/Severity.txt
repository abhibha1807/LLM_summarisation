Instruction: You are a chatbot who knows the task of 'Named Entity recognition'. You are provided with some clinical data related to a patients visit to the emergency department (ED) of a hospital. The target task is to extract the the words that belong to the entity ‘Severity’. For that we will first extract words related to the entity 'Chief Complaint' and then based on that we will extract the words related to ’Severity’. I will now give you the definition of both entities.\n 
'Chief complaint' is the main issue/problem that the patient presents to the ED with.\n 
'Severity’ describes the intensity of the chief problem usually from a scale of  1-10.

You have to make sure that you follow the definition I provide and not interpret the meaning of ’Severity’ in a general way. So I will be providing with you some examples on how to extract the entities 'Chief Complaint' and 'Severity’. Basically we will be trying to mimic a physicians train of thought on how to extract these entities. We will be first looking for words that usually mark the starting of phrases related to 'Chief Complaint'. For example, 'presents with', 'complains of', 'comes to/in', etc and mostly the actual chief complaint follows these words. For 'Severity’ we will be looking for a rating like ‘9 out of 10’ or ‘2-4 out of 10’ or ‘6/10’ and not phrases like 'mild', 'moderate' and 'severe'.

Putting this down into steps:
1)Identify the verb phrase that indicates the chief complaint. 
2)Identify the specific phrase that describes the chief problem. 
3)Identify the phrase that describes the ‘Severity’ of the chief problem
4) Based on step 3, should you give an output? Answer yes or no 
5) Provide the final phrase. 


Now I will provide you with an example on how to extract the entity 'Chief Complaint' and then the entity 'Severity'. 

Example1:  patient is a 65-year-old comes to emergency room for chest pain. the patient was admitted on to go to the hospital for atrial fibrillation, and a small pericardial effusion. he has been seen by cardiology in the interim. now he is having 24 hours chest pain pressure like on the left side of his chest, she denies fever, denies syncope. he is 4 out of 10 pressure-like. history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, prostate cancer  

1)Identify the verb phrase that indicates the chief complaint.  - comes to emergency room for chest pain
2)Identify the specific phrase that describes the chief problem.  - chest pain 
3)Identify the phrase that describes the ‘Severity’ of the chief problem - 4 out of 10 pressure-like
4)  Based on step 3, should you give an output? Answer yes or no - yes
5) Provide the final phrase. - @4 out of 10@



Now I will provide you with an example where the Chief Complaint is  present and but the entity Severity  is not present.

2)Identify the specific phrase that describes the chief problem.  - chest pressure
3)Identify the phrase that describes the ‘Severity’ of the chief problem - not provided
4)  Based on step 3, should you give an output? Answer yes or no - no

Now I will provide you with an example where the Chief Complaint is not present and as a result the entity Severity is not present as well.
