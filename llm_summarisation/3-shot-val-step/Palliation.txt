Instruction: 
You are a chatbot who knows the task of 'Named Entity recognition'. You are provided with some clinical data 
related to a patients visit to the emergency department (ED) of a hospital. The target task is to extract the the words
that belong to the entity Palliation. For that we will first extract words related to the entity 'Chief Complaint' and then based on that
we will extract the words related to Palliation. I will now give you the definition of both entities.\n

'Chief complaint' is the main issue/problem that the patient presents to the ED with.
'Palliation' is the activity, position or medication that makes the chief complaint better. Note
that it is not the activity or position that brought about the onset of the chief complaint but rather the activity 
or medication or position that made the chief complaint better. 

You have to make sure that you follow the definition I provide and not interpret the meaning of Palliation in a 
general way. So I will be providing you some examples on how to extract the entities 'Chief Complaint' and Palliation. 
Basically we will be trying to mimic a physicians train of thought on how to extract these entities. 

For â€˜Palliates' we will be looking mentions of any particular action (Eg: bending down, climbing stairs, etc), position (Eg: sitting, laying down, etc) or medication (Eg: Tylenol, etc) that are making the symptoms better. 


Putting this down into steps:\n

1) Identify the verb tense that indicates the chief complaint.
2) Identify the specific phrase that describes the chief problem.
3) Identify the  phrase that indicates any position, medication or action that is making the chief complaint better
4) Based on step 3, should you give an output? Answer yes or no 
5) Provide the final phrase 

Now I will provide you with an example on how to extract the entity 'Chief Complaint' and then the entity  Palliation 

Example1: this is a 73-year-old male comes in for evaluation of chest pain. he states the  chest pain started about 7 or 7:30 this evening was off and on got progressively worse. he took some aspirin is  morphine tablet and nitroglycerin at home with some relief of the chest pain but was still having its recall the  ambulance committed for evaluation. he also had some mild shortness of breath. denied any nausea or vomiting. 
denied any diaphoresis. no lightheadedness or dizziness. denies any syncope or presyncope. no other complaints at  this time. symptoms are moderate in severity. nothing is made this worse the nitroglycerin aspirated did seem to  help somewhat. \n

Reasoning steps:\n
1) Identify the verb tense that indicates the chief complaint.- comes in for evaluation of chest pain \n
2) Identify the specific phrase that describes the chief problem. - chest pain \n
3) Identify the  phrase that indicates any position, medication or action that is making the chief complaint better - the nitroglycerin aspirated did seem to  help somewhat \n
4) Based on step 3, should you give an output? Answer yes or no - yes
5) Provide the  final phrase - @the nitroglycerin aspirated did seem to  help somewhat@ \n


Now I will provide you with an example where the Chief Complaint is  present and but the entity Palliation  is not present. 

Example2: patient is a 92-year-old female, comes to emergency room after he she feels short of breath, the patient has history of mitral valve disease, exacerbation, cabg, cad , congestive heart failure, hypertension , pulmonary edema ,copd, history of neuropathy, history of diverticulosis. he has increased dyspnea some shortness of breath on ambulation, she denies fever. she is called her pcp and she was instructed to come to the emergency room. son is telling me that every year she gets admitted for something similar last time, she was admitted because she had some sort of infection. she denies fever at this time,syncope or chest pain.  patient is on coumadin


1) Identify the verb tense that indicates the chief complaint.- she feels short of breath,  \n
2) Identify the specific phrase that describes the chief problem. - short of breath \n
3) Identify the  phrase that indicates any position, medication or action that is making the chief complaint better - not provided
4) Based on step 3, should you give an output? Answer yes or no - no
5) Provide the  final phrase - @ @ \n


Now I will provide you with an example where the Chief Complaint is not present and as a result the entity  Palliation is not present as well. 


Example3: Medications: per nursing records .

1)Identify the verb phrase that indicates the chief complaint. -  not provided
