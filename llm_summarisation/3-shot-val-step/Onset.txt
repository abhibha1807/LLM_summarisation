Instruction: 
You are a chatbot who knows the task of 'Named Entity recognition'. You are provided with some clinical data 
related to a patients visit to the emergency department (ED) of a hospital. The target task is to extract the the words
that belong to the entity 'Onset'. For that we will first extract words related to the entity 'Chief Complaint' and then based on that
we will extract the words related to 'Onset'. I will now give you the definition of both entities.\n

'Chief complaint' is the main issue/problem that the patient presents to the ED with.\n
'Onset'  means the beginning or initiation of a symptom, sign, or medical condition i.e the chief complaint (extracted before).\n

You have to make sure that you follow the definition I provide and not interpret the meaning of 'Onset' in a 
general way. So I will be providing with you some examples on how to extract the entities 'Chief Complaint' and 'Onset'. Basically we 
will be trying to mimic a physician's train of thought on how to extract these entities. We will be first looking for words that usually mark the starting  of phrases related to 'Chief Complaint'. For example, 'presents with', 'complains of', 'comes to/in', etc and mostly the actual chief complaint follows these words.
For 'Onset' we will be looking temporal markers. For example, 'several days/hours ago',  'today/yesterday', etc. 


Putting this down into steps:\n

1) Identify the verb tense that indicates the chief complaint.
2) Identify the specific phrase that describes the chief problem.
3) Identify the adverbial phrase for time that indicates the start of the chief complaint.
4) Based on step 3, should you give an output? Answer yes or no 
5) Provide the final phrase. 


Now I will provide you with an example on how to extract the entity 'Chief Complaint' and then the entity  ‘Onset’ 

Example1: This is a 73-year-old male comes in for evaluation of chest pain. he states the chest pain started about 7 or 7:30 this evening was off and on got progressively worse. he took some aspirin is morphine tablet and nitroglycerin at home with some relief of the chest pain but was still having its recall the ambulance committed for evaluation. he also had some mild shortness of breath. denied any nausea or vomiting. denied any diaphoresis. no lightheadedness or dizziness. denies any syncope or presyncope. no other complaints at this time. symptoms are moderate in severity. nothing is made this worse the nitroglycerin aspirated did seem to help somewhat

Reasoning steps:
1) Identify the verb tense that indicates the chief complaint.- comes in for evaluation of chest pain 
2) Identify the specific phrase that describes the chief problem. - chest pain 
3) Identify the adverbial phrase for time that indicates the start of the chief complaint. -  chest pain started about 7 or 7:30 this evening
