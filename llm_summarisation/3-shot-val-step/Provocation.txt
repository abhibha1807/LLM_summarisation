Instruction: 
You are a chatbot who knows the task of 'Named Entity recognition'. You are provided with some clinical data 
related to a patients visit to the emergency department (ED) of a hospital. The target task is to extract the the words
that belong to the entity Provocation. For that we will first extract words related to the entity 'Chief Complaint' and then based on that
we will extract the words related to Provocation. I will now give you the definition of both entities.\n

'Chief complaint' is the main issue/problem that the patient presents to the ED with.
Provocation is the activity, position or medication that makes the chief complaint worse. Note
that it is not the activity or position that brought about the onset of the chief complaint but rather the activity 
or position that further worsened the chief complaint. 

You have to make sure that you follow the definition I provide and not interpret the meaning of 'Provokes' in a 
general way. So I will be providing you some examples on how to extract the entities 'Chief Complaint' and 'Provokes. 
Basically we will be trying to mimic a physicians train of thought on how to extract these entities. 

For 'Provokes’ we will be looking mentions of any particular action (Eg: bending down, climbing stairs, etc), position (Eg: sitting, laying down, etc) that are making the symptoms worse. 

Putting this down into steps:\n

1) Identify the verb tense that indicates the chief complaint.
2) Identify the specific phrase that describes the chief problem.
3) Identify the  phrase that indicates any position, medication or action that is making the chief complaint worse
4) Based on step 3, should you give an output? Answer yes or no 
5) Provide the final phrase 

Example: Here are some examples to extract the entity 'Provokes’ 


Now I will provide you with an example on how to extract the entity 'Chief Complaint' and then the entity  Provocation 

Example1: this is a 73-year-old male comes in for evaluation of chest pain. he states the  chest pain started about 7 or 7:30 this evening was off and on got progressively worse. he took some aspirin is  morphine tablet and nitroglycerin at home with some relief of the chest pain but was still having its recall the  ambulance committed for evaluation. he also had some mild shortness of breath. denied any nausea or vomiting. 
denied any diaphoresis. no lightheadedness or dizziness. denies any syncope or presyncope. no other complaints at  this time. symptoms are moderate in severity. nothing is made this worse the nitroglycerin aspirated did seem to  help somewhat. \n

Reasoning steps:\n
1) Identify the verb tense that indicates the chief complaint.- comes in for evaluation of chest pain \n
2) Identify the specific phrase that describes the chief problem. - chest pain \n
3) Identify the  phrase that indicates any position, medication or action that is making the chief complaint worse -  nothing is made this worse
4) Based on step 3, should you give an output? Answer yes or no - yes
5) Provide the  final phrase - @nothing is made this worse@ \n



Now I will provide you with an example where the Chief Complaint is  present and but the entity Provocation  is not present. 

Example2: 39-year-old white female presents with chest tightness. she relates that she was initially seen at a medics present was concern for blood clot so they sent her here. she relates she has a history of pulmonary embolus in her family. she has pain in her back at times. she denies any shortness of breath. she's had no syncope. she's had no recent illnesses.


1) Identify the verb tense that indicates the chief complaint.- presents with chest tightness. \n
2) Identify the specific phrase that describes the chief problem. - chest tightness \n
3) Identify the  phrase that indicates any position, medication or action that is making the chief complaint worse - not provided 
4) Based on step 3, should you give an output? Answer yes or no - no
5) Provide the  final phrase - @ @ \n

Now I will provide you with an example where the Chief Complaint is not present and as a result the entity  Provocation is not present as well. 

Example3: Medications: per nursing records .

1)Identify the verb phrase that indicates the chief complaint. -  not provided
2) Provide the final phrase. @ @
