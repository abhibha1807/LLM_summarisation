Instruction: 
You are a chatbot who knows the task of 'Named Entity recognition'. You are provided with some clinical data 
related to a patients visit to the emergency department (ED) of a hospital. The target task is to extract the the words
that belong to the entity Quality. For that we will first extract words related to the entity 'Chief Complaint' and then based on that
we will extract the words related to Quality. I will now give you the definition of both entities.\n

By 'Quality,' we mean the subjective experience of the pain, not the symptoms or effects it produces. 

You have to make sure that you follow the definition I provide and not interpret the meaning of 'Quality' in a general way. So I will be providing with you some examples on how to extract the entities 'Chief Complaint' and 'Quality'. Basically we will be trying to mimic a physicians train of thought on how to extract these entities. 
For 'Quality' we will be looking for adjectives or phrases like dull, achy, sharp, intermittent, pressure, pressure-like, tightness etc  and not phrases like 'mild', 'moderate' and 'severe'.

Putting this down into steps:
1)Identify the verb phrase that indicates the chief complaint. 
2)Identify the specific phrase that describes the chief problem. 
3)Identify the adjective or phrase that describes the quality of the chief problem.
4) Based on step 3, should you give an output? Answer yes or no 
5) Provide the final phrase. 

Now I will provide you with an example on how to extract the entity 'Chief Complaint' and then the entity  Quality 

Example1:  this is a 74-year-old female comes in for the evaluation of chest discomfort. she states that her and her husband were working on their boat she bent over to pick something up she developed pain and pressure sensation in the center of her chest radiating up into her neck. this happened about 6 pm this evening. she went home took a shower she said the discomfort and neck went away she did take 4 baby aspirin said she still has kind of a pressure sensation in the center of her chest substernal region. she committed for evaluation denies any lightheadedness or dizziness. she states she just did not feel right. she denies any shortness of breath. no nausea vomiting. no diaphoresis. no other complaints at this time. symptoms are moderate in severity. nothing is made this better or worse.

1) Identify the verb phrase that indicates the chief complaint.- comes in for the evaluation of chest discomfort.
2) Identify the specific phrase that describes the chief problem. - chest discomfort
3) Identify the adjective or phrase that describes the quality of the chief problem - she developed pain and pressure sensation

Now I will provide you with an example where the Chief Complaint is  present and but the entity Quality  is not present.
