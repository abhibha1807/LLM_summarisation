Instruction: 
You are a chatbot who knows the task of 'Named Entity recognition'. You are provided with some clinical data 
related to a patients visit to the emergency department (ED) of a hospital. The target task is to extract the the words
that belong to the entity Radiation. For that we will first extract words related to the entity 'Chief Complaint' and then based on that
we will extract the words related to Radiation. I will now give you the definition of both entities.\n

'Radiation,' is how you can determine where the pain  radiates or moves into another area. There are two main kinds of pain patients can report: Referred or reflective pain occurs when the patient experiences pain that  is in a location of the body other than at the site of the pain stimulus.  Referred pain can provide clues to  certain underlying causes. Localized pain refers to pain that stays in a particular location without spreading. 

You have to make sure that you follow the definition I provide and not interpret the meaning of ‘Radiation’ 
in a general way. So I will be providing with you some examples on how to extract the entities 'Chief Complaint'
And ‘Radiation’. Basically we will be trying to mimic a physicians train of thought on how to extract 
these entities. 

For ‘Radiation’ we will be looking for phrases that talk about  where the pain is radiating. Basically we are looking for phrases like radiating to left/right side of chest/arm, etc.

Putting this down into steps:
1)Identify the verb phrase that indicates the chief complaint. 
2)Identify the specific phrase that describes the chief problem. 
3) Identify the phrase that describes whether pain is radiating?
4)  Based on step 3, should you give an output? Answer yes or no 
5) Provide the final phrase.

Now I will provide you with an example on how to extract the entity 'Chief Complaint' and then the entity 
'Radiation'. 

Example1: 97-year-old white female presents after an episode of chest pain. the pain was retrosternal and radiated to her left arm. she has some associated nausea and diaphoresis of the time. she arrives here pain-free. she does have a history of cardiac stents. she relates she has not had a recent cardiac catheterization.

1)Identify the verb phrase that indicates the chief complaint. -  presents after an episode of chest pain
2)Identify the specific phrase that describes the chief problem. - chest pain
3) Identify the phrase that describes whether pain is radiating? radiated to her left arm
4)  Based on step 3, should you give an output? Answer yes or no - yes
5) Provide the final phrase. @radiated to her left arm@


Now I will provide you with an example where the Chief Complaint is  present and but the entity Radiation  is not present. 

Example2: "this is an 82-year-old female known history of hypertension coronary disease presents with a onset of chest pain that started several hours ago. she did receive some aspirin. she states that her chest pain was resolved after one nitroglycerin. they do give her a second one secondary to her blood pressure being over 200 systolic. she presents here now and being chest pain-free. she states it was associated with some mild shortness of breath. she denied any diaphoresis. no nausea vomiting. patient is blind. she denied any syncope or presyncope. she does a mild headache now from the nitroglycerin.she denied any nausea to me. no vomiting. no diaphoresis. symptoms are moderate in severity. nitroglycerin made this better. nothing is made it worse",
